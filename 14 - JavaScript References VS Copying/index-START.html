    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // changeing the original does not change the copy
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);

    let name = "Keize";
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = "Keizer!!!"
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;
    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log(players, team);
    // when either array is updated it changes the reference!!!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // if you pass slice() nothing it will make a copy of the original array
    team2[3] = 'Baxter';
    console.log(players, team, team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    team3[3] = 'Puddles';
    console.log(players, team, team2, team3);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread [...]
    // Spread takes every item out of iterable and puts it into new container
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'Snickers';
    console.log(players, team, team2, team3, team4);
    // or use Array.from() method
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed :)

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Keize Pappa!',
      age: 7
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 100;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // Object.assign({}, , ) where we define
    // Object.assign({copy to}, copy from, what's replaced in copy)
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 14 });

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
